Hey!

I'm an enterprise storage technologist in the day and a cyber security researcher and bug hunter by the evening. Additionally, I'm passionate about combat arts. In my free time I'm either researching a cyber security topic or visualizing/practicing unarmed combat techniques. I have realised that the research I am doing and the knowledge I have gathered has remained confined in me. As a result I have been losing out on the interaction and the possibility of improving it. 

Therefore, I chose to write about my research projects, observations and publish it via this blog to initiate collaboration and interaction on cyber security and other topics.

Thank you!
